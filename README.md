Statement:

This is the first tableau dashboard built by me to calculate total profits generated by different segment, category and city.

This is guided project we can find in Tableau page:
Link:https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/how-to-videos

I have made some changes to the dashboard to learn the things on my own.

I have used Bar Chart, Line Chart, maps and table widgets for visualization.


Steps Followed:
-Step 1: Load the data into Tableau public, dataset is excel sheet.
-Step 2: once we load the data, saw the preview of dataset in Data source pane,and then click on New worksheet option.
-Step 3:Once worksheet pane opens, drag and drop the region column from dimension to the rows section. 
-Step 4:filtered out only those region which has profit >0, which is calculated.
Step 5: Added all the worksheet together in dashboard sheet.


There are 5 worksheets:
(i) Profit Ratio by Geography.

(iii)Profit by Segment.
In this sheet we have divided profits into 2 categories, segment which has profits greater than 0 will be shown as Profitable and which has profits less than 0 will be shown as Non-Profitable.
